# Celestial-Smoothie

This is my first ever personal project. Fully designed by myself on Figma. It's a fictional homepage. Tried to apply as much as possible my basic knowledges of HTML/CSS. Helped me deal with staying as close as possible to pixel perfect, adding :roots, reset to get started, and applying correctly flexbox, position and so on.
